Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes.

Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes.

Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes. We need to output in \\boxed{}. Thus \\boxed{204}. But we need to ensure that the answer is number of minutes the walk takes her, including t minutes. So answer is 204. Thus final answer: \\boxed{204}. We need to provide step-by-step solution. The problem statement includes \"Solution:\" but we need to fill in. Thus answer: \\boxed{204}. But we need to check if any nuance: The problem says \"When she walks at a constant speed of s kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So total time includes coffee shop time. So we solved correctly. Thus answer is 204. We can also consider alternative interpretation: She walks 9 km and stops at coffee shop afterwards, meaning after walking she goes to coffee shop (maybe extra distance?) But the problem likely means she walks 9 km, then coffee shop. So distance is 9 km. Thus answer stands. Now we need to output final answer in \\boxed{}. Thus final answer: \\boxed{204}. We need to include step-by-step reasoning? The problem says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to produce a solution with steps and final answer. Thus we can produce a solution: Let t minutes = t/60 hours. Write equations, solve for s, find t, compute new total time, convert to minutes. Then final answer. We'll output final answer in \\boxed{204}. Should we include any other formatting? The final answer must be in \\boxed{}. We'll output only that? The instructions: \"You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to include final answer in \\boxed{}. We can also include steps before that. So final answer: \\boxed{204}.
