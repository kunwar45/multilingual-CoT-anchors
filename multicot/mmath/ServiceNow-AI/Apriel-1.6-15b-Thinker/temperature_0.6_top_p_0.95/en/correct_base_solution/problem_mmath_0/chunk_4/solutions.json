Find total time (in minutes) when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h.\n\nWe need to solve for s and t.\n\nLet walking time at speed s be 9/s hours. Then total time = 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours. Similarly, at speed s+2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Actually 24 minutes = 0.4 hours.

Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. She walks at constant speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including t). When she walks at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours and 24 minutes (including t). Find total time (in minutes) when walking at speed s + 0.5 km/h.\n\nWe need to solve for s and t.\n\nLet walking time at speed s be 9/s hours. Then total time = 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.

So t/60 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 => t = 0.4*60 = 24 minutes.\n\nCheck second: 9/(2.5+2) = 9/4.5 = 2.0 hours. t/60 = 0.4 => total = 2.4 hours = 2h24m.

So total = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m.\n\nConvert to minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: 204.\n\nBut we need to output in \\boxed{}.

Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. The walk distance is 9 km, speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours = 240 minutes.

So walking time = 2.4 - t minutes.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\nWalking time at speed s: 9 / s = 4 - t/60 (since t minutes = t/60 hours). Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. So walking time = total time - t minutes. So 9 / s = 4 - t/60.\n\nSimilarly, 9 / (s+2) = 2.4 - t/60.\n\nWe have two unknowns s and t. Solve.\n\nLet’s denote T = t/60 (hours). Then:\n\n9 / s = 4 - T   (1)\n9 / (s+2) = 2.4 - T   (2)\n\nSubtract (2) from (1): 9/s - 9/(s+2) = (4 - T) - (2.4 - T) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6.\n\nSo 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6.\n\nCompute left side: 9 * (1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 9 * ((s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))) = 9 * (2 / (s(s+2))) = 18 / (s(s+2)).\n\nThus 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6.\n\nSo s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25? Let's compute: 18 / 1.6 = (18*10)/(16) = 180/16 = 11.25. Yes.\n\nThus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.\n\nSolve quadratic: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2.\n\nWe need positive s, so s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h. The other root is negative: (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5, discard.\n\nThus s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow find T = t/60. Use equation (1): 9 / s = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours. So 9/s = 3.6 = 4 - T => T = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours = 24 minutes. So t = 24 minutes.\n\nCheck with second equation: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0 hours. Actually 9/4.5 = 2.0 exactly. Then total time = walking time + t = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours = 2h24m, matches.\n\nThus t = 24 minutes.\n\nNow we need to find the total time when walking speed = s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.

So walking time = 2.4 - t minutes.\n\nWe have two equations:\n\nWalking time at speed s: 9 / s = 4 - t/60 (since t minutes = t/60 hours). Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. So walking time = total time - t minutes. So 9 / s = 4 - t/60.\n\nSimilarly, 9 / (s+2) = 2.4 - t/60.\n\nWe have two unknowns s and t. Solve.\n\nLet’s denote T = t/60 (hours). Then:\n\n9 / s = 4 - T   (1)\n9 / (s+2) = 2.4 - T   (2)\n\nSubtract (2) from (1): 9/s - 9/(s+2) = (4 - T) - (2.4 - T) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6.\n\nSo 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6.\n\nCompute left side: 9 * (1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 9 * ((s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))) = 9 * (2 / (s(s+2))) = 18 / (s(s+2)).\n\nThus 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6.\n\nSo s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25? Let's compute: 18 / 1.6 = (18*10)/(16) = 180/16 = 11.25. Yes.\n\nThus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.\n\nSolve quadratic: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2.\n\nWe need positive s, so s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h. The other root is negative: (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5, discard.\n\nThus s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow find T = t/60. Use equation (1): 9 / s = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours. So 9/s = 3.6 = 4 - T => T = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 hours = 24 minutes. So t = 24 minutes.\n\nCheck with second equation: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0 hours. Actually 9/4.5 = 2.0 exactly. Then total time = walking time + t = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours = 2h24m, matches.\n\nThus t = 24 minutes.\n\nNow we need to find the total time when walking speed = s + 1/2 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Then total time = walking time + t minutes = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m = 3 + 24/60 = 3.4 hours. But we need answer in minutes: total minutes = 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: 204 minutes.\n\nCheck: The problem asks: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer: 204.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to output in the required format: \\boxed{204}. Also we need to show step-by-step solution? The prompt says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{{}}.\" So we can include reasoning but final answer must be boxed.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n[BEGIN FINAL RESPONSE]\nLet \\(t\\) be the coffee‑shop time in minutes and \\(s\\) the walking speed in km/h.\n\nTotal time (in hours) = walking time + \\(\\dfrac{t}{60}\\).\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}=4-\\frac{t}{60}\\qquad (1)\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s+2}=2.4-\\frac{t}{60}\\qquad (2)\n\\]\n\nSubtract (2) from (1):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}=4-2.4=1.6\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right)=\\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=1.6\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns(s+2)=\\frac{18}{1.6}=11.25\n\\]\n\n\\[\ns^{2}+2s-11.25=0\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; s=\\frac{-2+\\sqrt{49}}{2}=2.5\\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nFrom (1):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5}=3.6=4-\\frac{t}{60}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\frac{t}{60}=0.4\\text{ h}\n\\]\n\n\\[\nt=0.4\\times60=24\\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow walk at \\(s+\\frac12=2.5+0.5=3.0\\) km/h.\n\nWalking time \\(= \\dfrac{9}{3}=3\\) h = 180 min.\n\nTotal time \\(=180\\text{ min}+24\\text{ min}=204\\) min.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\n",
