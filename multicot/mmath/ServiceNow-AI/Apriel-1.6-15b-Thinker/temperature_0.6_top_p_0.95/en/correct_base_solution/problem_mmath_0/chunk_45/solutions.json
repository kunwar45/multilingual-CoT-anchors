Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes.

Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes.

Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes. We need to output in \\boxed{}. So \\boxed{204}. That's the solution.\n\nBut the problem statement says \"Solution: \" maybe they want the solution steps? The prompt says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: ...\" So we need to output the answer only? Usually they want the final answer in a box. But they also say \"Solution:\" maybe they want to fill in solution steps. However the instruction says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to provide step-by-step reasoning and final answer in box. We'll produce a solution with steps. Let's ensure we include the final answer in \\boxed{}. The final answer: 204.\n\nWe must be careful: The problem asks \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer is 204 minutes.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}. We'll include steps.\n\nNow let's produce final answer.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Let }t\\text{ be the coffee‑shop time in minutes.}\\\\\n&\\text{When speed}=s\\text{ km/h: } \\frac{9}{s}+\\frac{t}{60}=4 \\quad\\text{(hours)}\\tag{1}\\\\\n&\\text{When speed}=s+2\\text{ km/h: } \\frac{9}{s+2}+\\frac{t}{60}=2\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=2.4 \\tag{2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSubtract (2) from (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}=4-2.4=1.6.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\Bigr)=9\\frac{2}{s(s+2)}=\\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\ns(s+2)=\\frac{18}{1.6}=11.25.\n\\]\n\nSolve \\(s^{2}+2s-11.25=0\\):\n\\[\ns=\\frac{-2+\\sqrt{4+45}}{2}=\\frac{-2+7}{2}=2.5\\ \\text{km/h}\n\\]\n(the negative root is extraneous).\n\nFind \\(t\\) from (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5}=3.6,\\qquad 3.6+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\implies \\frac{t}{60}=0.4\\implies t=24\\text{ min}.\n\\]\n\nNow for speed \\(s+\\frac12 = 2.5+0.5 = 3.0\\) km/h:\n\\[\n\\text{walking time}= \\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h},\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{total time}=3\\text{ h}+ \\frac{24}{60}\\text{ h}=3.4\\text{ h}=3\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=204\\text{ min}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\n",
