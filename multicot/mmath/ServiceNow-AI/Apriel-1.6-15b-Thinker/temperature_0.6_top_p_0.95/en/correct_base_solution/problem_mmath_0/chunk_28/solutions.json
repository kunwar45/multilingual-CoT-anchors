So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km.

Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. So s(s+2) = 11.25 => s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 => Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2. Positive root: (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h. Negative root: (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 (reject). So s = 2.5 km/h. Then t: use Eq1: 9/s + t/60 = 4 => 9/2.5 = 3.6? Actually 9/2.5 = 3.6 (since 2.5*3.6 = 9). So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Indeed 9/4.5 = 2. So 2 + t/60 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours = 2h24m. Works.\n\nNow we need total time for speed s+0.5 = 2.5+0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours. Add t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. Convert to minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. So answer: 204 minutes.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.

Let's output that.\n\nBut we need to ensure we follow the format: \"You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to include \\boxed{204} at the end.\n\nWe can also include the steps before that. The user wants a step-by-step solution. So we need to show steps.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWill that be accepted? Yes.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Let }s\\text{ be the walking speed (km/h) and }t\\text{ the coffee‑shop time (minutes).}\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Total time (hours)}= \\frac{9}{s}+\\frac{t}{60}=4 \\qquad (1)\\\\\n&\\text{Total time (hours)}= \\frac{9}{s+2}+\\frac{t}{60}=2\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=2.4 \\qquad (2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSubtract (2) from (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}=4-2.4=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\n9\\Big(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\Big)=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\n9\\cdot\\frac{2}{s(s+2)}=1.6\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\ns(s+2)=\\frac{18}{1.6}=11.25\n\\]\n\\[\ns^{2}+2s-11.25=0\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; s=\\frac{-2+\\sqrt{49}}{2}=2.5\\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nFind \\(t\\) using (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5}+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;3.6+\\frac{t}{60}=4\n\\]\n\\[\n\\frac{t}{60}=0.4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;t=24\\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow for speed \\(s+\\frac12 = 2.5+0.5 = 3.0\\) km/h:\n\\[\n\\text{Walking time}= \\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total time}=3\\text{ h}+24\\text{ min}=3\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=3.4\\text{ h}\n\\]\nConvert to minutes:\n\\[\n3.4\\text{ h}\\times60 = 204\\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\\]\n\n",
