Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h.

Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 hours. So 9[1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 1.6. Compute left side: 9[(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9[2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)). So 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25? Let's compute: 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 exactly? 1.6*10 = 16, 1.6*11 = 17.6, 1.6*11.25 = 18. So yes s(s+2) = 11.25. So s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2. Positive root: (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h. Negative root: (-2 -7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject). So s = 2.5 km/h. Then compute t from Eq1: 9/s + t/60 = 4 => 9/2.5 = 3.6? Let's compute: 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(2.5+2) = 9/4.5 = 2.0. Then 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours = 2h24m. Works.\n\nNow we need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add coffee shop time t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. So answer: 204 minutes. Must output in \\boxed{}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to ensure we follow the instruction: \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{{}}.\" So we need to produce a solution with steps and final answer in \\boxed{}. Let's produce a thorough step-by-step solution.\n\nWe can also express the answer as minutes. The problem asks: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer is 204 minutes. So final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nThus we output final answer.\n\nBut the prompt includes \"Solution:\" maybe they want the solution steps? The prompt says \"Solution:\" but not given.

So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h.
