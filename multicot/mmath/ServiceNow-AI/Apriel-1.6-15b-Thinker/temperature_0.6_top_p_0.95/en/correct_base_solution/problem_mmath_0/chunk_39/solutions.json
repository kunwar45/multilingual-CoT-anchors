So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add coffee shop t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. So answer: 204 minutes. Must put in \\boxed{}. So \\boxed{204}. That's the solution.\n\nBut the problem likely expects the answer in minutes. Yes. So final answer: \\boxed{204}. Let's also double-check the arithmetic: s = 2.5 km/h. At speed 2.5 km/h, walking time = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3h 36m. Add coffee shop 24m = 3h 60m = 4h. Good. At speed 4.5 km/h, walking time = 9/4.5 = 2.0h = 2h. Add coffee shop 24m = 2h24m. Good. At speed 3.0 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3h. Add coffee shop 24m = 3h24m = 204m. So answer correct.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{204}. That is the number of minutes.\n\nNow we need to produce a step-by-step solution. The problem says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: ...\" So we need to output a solution with steps and final answer in \\boxed{}. Let's produce a clear solution.\n\nWe can also show the algebra.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow we need to output the solution. Should we include any extra text? The instruction says \"You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}\". It doesn't forbid additional explanation before that. So we can give step-by-step reasoning and then final answer.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to ensure the final answer is in a LaTeX box: \\boxed{204}.
