We need to provide solution.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to check if any nuance: The problem says \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer is minutes, which we computed as 204 minutes.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to include steps.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow we need to output final answer.\n\nWe need to ensure we have a step-by-step solution.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe'll output that.\n[BEGIN FINAL RESPONSE]\nLet \\(t\\) be the coffee‑shop time in **minutes**.  \nConvert it to hours: \\(\\displaystyle \\frac{t}{60}\\).\n\nThe 9‑km walk at speed \\(s\\) km/h takes \\( \\frac{9}{s}\\) hours, so\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}+\\frac{t}{60}=4 \\qquad (1)\n\\]\n\nAt speed \\(s+2\\) km/h the total time is \\(2\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=2.4\\) h:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s+2}+\\frac{t}{60}=2.4 \\qquad (2)\n\\]\n\nSubtract (2) from (1):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}=4-2.4=1.6.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n9\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right)=\\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=1.6=\\frac{8}{5}.\n\\]\n\nThus\n\n\\[\n\\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=\\frac{8}{5}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; 90=8s(s+2)\n\\]\n\\[\ns(s+2)=\\frac{45}{4}\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;4s^{2}+8s-45=0.\n\\]\n\nSolve:\n\n\\[\ns=\\frac{-8\\pm\\sqrt{64+720}}{8}=\\frac{-8\\pm28}{8}\\Rightarrow s=2.5\\text{ km/h} \\;(\\text{positive root}).\n\\]\n\nNow find \\(t\\) using (1):\n\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5}+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;3.6+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\frac{t}{60}=0.4,\n\\]\n\\[\nt=24\\text{ minutes}.\n\\]\n\nFor the new speed \\(s+\\frac12 = 2.5+0.5 = 3.0\\) km/h:\n\n\\[\n\\text{walking time}= \\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h}.\n\\]\n\nAdd the coffee‑shop time:\n\n\\[\n3\\text{ h}+24\\text{ min}=3\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=3\\cdot60+24=204\\text{ minutes}.\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\n",
