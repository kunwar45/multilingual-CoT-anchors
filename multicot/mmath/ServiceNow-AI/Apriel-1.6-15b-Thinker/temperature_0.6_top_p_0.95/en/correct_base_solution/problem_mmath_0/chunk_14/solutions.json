So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is given in minutes; we need to convert to hours. Let t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time = (9 / s) + (t/60) = 4.

Let's compute: 1080/96 = 11.25 exactly (since 96*11 = 1056, remainder 24, 24/96=0.25). So s(s+2) = 11.25.\n\nSolve quadratic: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Multiply by 4 to avoid decimal: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0.

So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. t minutes = t/60 hours. So:\n\n9 / s + t/60 = 4.\n\nSimilarly: 9 / (s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.\n\nWe have two equations unknowns s and t. Solve.\n\nLet’s solve: 9/s + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 4 - 9/s => t = 60*(4 - 9/s) = 240 - 540/s.\n\nSecond: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 => t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s+2) => t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s+2)) = 144 - 540/(s+2).\n\nSet equal: 240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2). Solve:\n\n240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2)\n\nBring terms: 240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s+2)\n\n96 = 540 * (1/s - 1/(s+2))\n\nSimplify RHS: 540 * ((s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))) = 540 * (2 / (s(s+2))) = 1080 / (s(s+2))\n\nThus: 96 = 1080 / (s(s+2))\n\n=> s(s+2) = 1080 / 96 = 11.25? Let's compute: 1080/96 = 11.25 exactly (since 96*11 = 1056, remainder 24, 24/96=0.25). So s(s+2) = 11.25.\n\nSolve quadratic: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Multiply by 4 to avoid decimal: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0. Solve: s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)]/(8) = [-8 ± sqrt(784)]/8 = [-8 ± 28]/8.\n\nPositive root: (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5. Negative root: (-8 - 28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5 (reject). So s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nThus s = 2.5 km/h. Then t = 240 - 540/s = 240 - 540/2.5 = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes. Check second: t = 144 - 540/(s+2) = 144 - 540/(4.5) = 144 - 120 = 24. Good.\n\nNow we need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m.\n\nBut the problem asks: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer in minutes: 3 hours 24 minutes = 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer = \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to show step-by-step solution. The problem statement includes \"Solution:\" but not actual solution. We need to fill in. The answer must be in a box.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to output final answer only? The instruction: \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{{}}. Problem: ... Solution:\" So we need to provide solution steps and final answer in box. Let's produce a step-by-step solution.\n\nWe can present:\n\nLet t minutes = t/60 hours.\n\nEquation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4.\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.\n\nSubtract to eliminate t: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6.\n\nSimplify: 9*( (s+2) - s ) / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => 9*2/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 => 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18/1.6 = 11.25.\n\nSolve s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 => s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nThen find t: from eq1: t/60 = 4 - 9/2.5 = 4 - 3.6 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes.\n\nNow for speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h: walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours = 180 minutes. Add t = 24 => total = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe should double-check units: 9 km at 2.5 km/h = 3.6 hours = 3h24m. Wait 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3h24m. Add t = 24 min => total = 4h? Actually 3h24m + 24m = 4h. Yes matches given total 4h. Good.\n\nSecond: 9/(4.5) = 2 hours. Actually 9/4.5 = 2.0 hours. Add t = 24 min => total = 2h24m = 2.4h. Good.\n\nThus answer correct.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to output final answer only? The instruction: \"Solve this math problem step by step.

Problem: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t minutes is in minutes; need convert to hours. Let t be minutes. Then t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. So:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4. (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. (Equation 2)\n\nWe need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60, then convert to minutes.\n\nWe have two equations with unknowns s and t. Solve.\n\nSubtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6. So:\n\n9 (1/s - 1/(s+2)) = 1.6 => 9 ((s+2 - s)/(s(s+2))) = 1.6 => 9 (2/(s(s+2))) = 1.6 => (18)/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25? Wait 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 indeed. So s(s+2) = 11.25.\n\nThus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0. Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2. Positive root: (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5. Negative root: (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 (reject). So s = 2.5 km/h. Then s+2 = 4.5 km/h.\n\nNow find t: Use Eq1: 9/s + t/60 = 4. 9/2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/4.5 = 2.0. 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours = 2h24m, matches.\n\nNow find total time at speed s+0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = 9/3 = 3 hours.

Solve.\n\n240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2) => bring terms: 240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s+2) => 96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)). Compute RHS: 540*( (s+2 - s) / (s(s+2)) ) = 540*(2 / (s(s+2))) = 1080 / (s(s+2)). So we have:\n\n96 = 1080 / (s(s+2)) => s(s+2) = 1080 / 96 = simplify: 1080/96 = divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1080/12 = 90; 96/12 = 8 => 90/8 = 45/4 = 11.25. So s(s+2) = 45/4 = 11.25.\n\nThus s^2 + 2s - 45/4 = 0 => multiply by 4: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0. Solve quadratic: s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 - 4*4*(-45))] / (2*4) = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)] / 8 = [-8 ± sqrt(784)] / 8 = [-8 ± 28] / 8.\n\nThus two solutions: s = (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5; or s = (-8 - 28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5 (reject negative speed). So s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow find t: t = 240 - 540/s = 240 - 540/2.5 = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes. Check with other equation: t = 144 - 540/(s+2) = 144 - 540/(4.5) = 144 - 120 = 24 minutes. Good.\n\nThus t = 24 minutes.\n\nNow compute total time at speed s+0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes? Wait 0.4 hour = 24 minutes. So total = 3 hours 24 minutes = 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: 204 minutes.\n\nBut we must check if the problem expects answer in minutes. Yes: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer = 204.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to double-check the problem statement: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So the walk is 9 km, then she stops at coffee shop afterwards. So total time includes walking time and coffee shop time. Yes.\n\nNow we solved.\n\nBut we need to ensure the solution is correct: Let's verify the given times: At speed s = 2.5 km/h, walking time = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3 hours 36 minutes. Add t = 24 minutes => total = 4 hours (3h 36m + 24m = 4h). Good. At speed s+2 = 4.5 km/h, walking time = 9 / 4.5 = 2 hours. Add t = 24 minutes => total = 2h 24m = 2.4 hours. Good. So consistent.\n\nThus answer is 204 minutes.\n\nNow we need to produce final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut the problem might ask for \"the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer is 204.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to output step-by-step solution?

Problem: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. Let's convert t to hours: t minutes = t/60 hours. So we have:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4. (Equation 1)\n\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. (Equation 2)\n\nWe need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h: total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes (maybe answer in minutes). The problem asks: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer should be in minutes.\n\nThus we need to solve for s and t. Let's solve.\n\nEquation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 4 - 9/s => t = 60*(4 - 9/s) = 240 - 540/s.\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 => t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s+2) => t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s+2)) = 144 - 540/(s+2).\n\nSet t equal: 240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2). Solve.\n\n240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2) => bring terms: 240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s+2) => 96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2)). Compute RHS: 540*( (s+2 - s) / (s(s+2)) ) = 540*(2 / (s(s+2))) = 1080 / (s(s+2)). So we have:\n\n96 = 1080 / (s(s+2)) => s(s+2) = 1080 / 96 = simplify: 1080/96 = divide numerator and denominator by 12: 1080/12 = 90; 96/12 = 8 => 90/8 = 45/4 = 11.25. So s(s+2) = 45/4 = 11.25.\n\nThus s^2 + 2s - 45/4 = 0 => multiply by 4: 4s^2 + 8s - 45 = 0. Solve quadratic: s = [-8 ± sqrt(64 - 4*4*(-45))] / (2*4) = [-8 ± sqrt(64 + 720)] / 8 = [-8 ± sqrt(784)] / 8 = [-8 ± 28] / 8.\n\nThus two solutions: s = (-8 + 28)/8 = 20/8 = 2.5; or s = (-8 - 28)/8 = -36/8 = -4.5 (reject negative speed). So s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow find t: t = 240 - 540/s = 240 - 540/2.5 = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes. Check with other equation: t = 144 - 540/(s+2) = 144 - 540/(4.5) = 144 - 120 = 24 minutes. Good.\n\nThus t = 24 minutes.\n\nNow compute total time at speed s+0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes? Wait 0.4 hour = 24 minutes. So total = 3 hours 24 minutes = 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: 204 minutes.\n\nBut we must check if the problem expects answer in minutes. Yes: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer = 204.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to double-check the problem statement: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So the walk is 9 km, then she stops at coffee shop afterwards.

Yes.\n\nNow we solved.\n\nBut we need to ensure the solution is correct: Let's verify the given times: At speed s = 2.5 km/h, walking time = 9 / 2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3 hours 36 minutes.
