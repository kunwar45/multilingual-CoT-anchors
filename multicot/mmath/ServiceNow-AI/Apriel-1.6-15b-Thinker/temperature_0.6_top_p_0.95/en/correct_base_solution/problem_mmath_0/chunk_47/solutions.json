Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes.

Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes.

Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour. So total = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours. Convert to minutes: 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. In minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. Thus answer: 204 minutes. We need to output in \\boxed{}. Thus \\boxed{204}. But we need to ensure that the answer is number of minutes the walk takes her, including t minutes. So answer is 204. That seems straightforward.\n\nBut the problem might be a bit more subtle: The distance is 9 km, speed s, time includes coffee shop. So we solved correctly.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut the problem states \"Solution:\" and then blank. So we need to provide solution steps and final answer.\n\nWe need to produce final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to show steps. Let's produce a step-by-step solution.\n\nWe can also note that we can solve for s and t directly.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow we need to produce final answer only? The instruction says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to include step-by-step reasoning and final answer in box.\n\nThus we will output a solution with steps and final answer.\n\nWe need to ensure the answer is correct.\n\nDouble-check: s = 2.5 km/h, speed s+2 = 4.5 km/h, speed s+0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Distance = 9 km. Walking times: 9/2.5 = 3.6 h = 3h36m. Add coffee shop 24 min => total 4h. Good. 9/4.5 = 2h = 2h0m. Add 24 min => 2h24m. Good. 9/3 = 3h = 3h0m. Add 24 min => 3h24m = 204 min. So answer correct.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow we need to output final answer in \\boxed{}. We'll include steps.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe'll output solution with steps and final answer.\n\nGiven the instructions, we need to output only the final answer? The problem says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to include steps. We'll include a short step-by-step solution and final answer.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n\\text{Let }t\\text{ be the coffee‑shop time in minutes.}\\\\\n\\text{Convert }t\\text{ to hours: } \\frac{t}{60}.\\\\[4pt]\n\\text{For speed }s:\\quad \\frac{9}{s}+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\quad (1)\\\\\n\\text{For speed }s+2:\\quad \\frac{9}{s+2}+\\frac{t}{60}=2\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=2.4\\quad (2)\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\nSubtract (2) from (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}=4-2.4=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\n9\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\Bigr)=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\n9\\cdot\\frac{2}{s(s+2)}=1.6\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; \\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=1.6\n\\]\n\\[\ns(s+2)=\\frac{18}{1.6}=11.25\n\\]\n\\[\ns^{2}+2s-11.25=0\\;\\Longrightarrow\\; s=\\frac{-2+\\sqrt{49}}{2}=2.5\\text{ km/h}\n\\]\n\nFind \\(t\\) using (1):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{2.5}+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;3.6+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\frac{t}{60}=0.4\n\\]\n\\[\nt=24\\text{ minutes}\n\\]\n\nNow for speed \\(s+\\frac12 = 2.5+0.5 = 3.0\\) km/h:\n\\[\n\\text{walk time}= \\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{total time}=3\\text{ h}+\\frac{24}{60}\\text{ h}=3.4\\text{ h}=3\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=204\\text{ min}\n\\]\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\\]\n\n",
