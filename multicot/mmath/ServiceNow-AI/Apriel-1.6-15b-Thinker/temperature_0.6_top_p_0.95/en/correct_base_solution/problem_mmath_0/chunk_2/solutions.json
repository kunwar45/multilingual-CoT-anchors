Let t minutes = t/60 hours.\n\nSo total time (hours) = 9/s + t/60 = 4 hours.\n\nSimilarly, at speed s+2: total time = 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2 + 0.4 = 2.4 hours.\n\nThus we have two equations:\n\n9/s + t/60 = 4  (1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4  (2)\n\nSubtract (2) from (1): 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6\n\nCompute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2))\n\nThus 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6\n\nSolve for s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25\n\nThus s(s+2) = 11.25\n\nThat's a quadratic: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0\n\nSolve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)]/2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)]/2 = [-2 ± 7]/2\n\nWe need positive s, so s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h.

The problem asks: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer: 204 minutes.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to ensure the solution steps are clear and the answer is boxed.\n\nWe need to produce a solution step by step.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut the problem statement includes \"Solution:\" maybe they want the solution steps? The prompt says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{{}}.\" So we need to provide a step-by-step solution and then final answer in a box.\n\nThus we will produce a solution: define variables, set up equations, solve for s and t, compute new total time.\n\nWe need to ensure we include the steps.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow, we need to format as a final answer. We'll include the steps.\n\nNow, we need to consider any nuance: The problem says \"Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So the walk is 9 km, then coffee shop. So the distance is 9 km. The speeds are s km/h and s+2 km/h. The total times are 4 hours and 2 hours 24 minutes respectively, including coffee break t minutes. So we solved correctly.\n\nThus answer is 204 minutes.\n\nWe need to output the answer in a box: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe should also check if any rounding needed? No.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n[BEGIN FINAL RESPONSE]\nLet  \n\n* \\(s\\) = walking speed (km/h) when the total time is 4 h,  \n* \\(t\\) = minutes spent in the coffee shop,  \n* distance = 9 km.\n\n---\n\n**1. Write the walking‑time equations (in minutes).**  \n\nWalking time at speed \\(s\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s}\\text{ h}= \\frac{9}{s}\\cdot 60 = \\frac{540}{s}\\text{ min}=240-t .\n\\tag{1}\n\\]\n\nWalking time at speed \\(s+2\\):\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{s+2}\\text{ h}= \\frac{540}{s+2}\\text{ min}=144-t .\n\\tag{2}\n\\]\n\n---\n\n**2. Eliminate \\(t\\).**  \n\nFrom (1) and (2):\n\\[\n240-\\frac{540}{s}=144-\\frac{540}{s+2}.\n\\]\n\nSimplify:\n\\[\n96 = \\frac{540}{s}-\\frac{540}{s+2}\n    =540\\!\\left(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\right)\n    =540\\!\\left(\\frac{2}{s(s+2)}\\right)\n    =\\frac{1080}{s(s+2)}.\n\\]\n\nHence\n\\[\ns(s+2)=\\frac{1080}{96}= \\frac{45}{4}.\n\\]\n\nSo\n\\[\ns^{2}+2s-\\frac{45}{4}=0\\quad\\Longrightarrow\\quad\n4s^{2}+8s-45=0.\n\\]\n\nSolve:\n\\[\ns=\\frac{-8\\pm\\sqrt{64+720}}{8}\n   =\\frac{-8\\pm28}{8}.\n\\]\n\nThe positive root gives \\(s= \\frac{20}{8}=2.5\\) km/h.\n\n---\n\n**3. Find \\(t\\).**  \n\nFrom (1):\n\\[\nt = 240-\\frac{540}{s}=240-\\frac{540}{2.5}=240-216=24\\text{ min}.\n\\]\n\n(Checking with (2): \\(144-\\frac{540}{4.5}=144-120=24\\) min, consistent.)\n\n---\n\n**4. Compute total time at speed \\(s+\\frac12 = 2.5+0.5 = 3.0\\) km/h.**  \n\nWalking time:\n\\[\n\\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h}=180\\text{ min}.\n\\]\n\nAdd the coffee‑shop break:\n\\[\n180\\text{ min}+t = 180+24 = 204\\text{ min}.\n\\]\n\n---\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\n",
