Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m. Works. Now find total time for speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. Walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add t minutes = 24 minutes = 0.4 hour.",

Let's double-check: The total time for s+0.5 = 3 km/h yields walking time 9/3 = 3 hours. t = 24 min. So total = 3h + 24m = 204 min. Yes.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}. Should we include any steps? The problem says \"Solution:\". The user likely expects the solution steps. But the final answer must be in \\boxed{}. The user wrote \"Solution:\" but didn't provide steps. We need to provide a solution step by step and then final answer.\n\nWe need to output the solution. The user wants \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}. Problem: ... Solution:\". So we need to fill in the solution steps and then final answer. Probably we need to output the solution steps and final answer in a box.\n\nThus we will produce a solution with steps: define variables, set up equations, solve for s, t, compute total time for new speed, convert to minutes, final answer.\n\nWe need to ensure the final answer is in \\boxed{}.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{204}. We'll include steps.\n\nPotential pitfalls: need to ensure we convert minutes correctly. Already done.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWill output solution.\n\nNow, let's consider if any nuance: The problem states \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So the coffee shop is after the walk, not part of the distance. So the distance is 9 km. Good.\n\nNow, check if any other interpretation: Could the coffee shop be halfway? No, it's after the walk. So we are correct.\n\nThus answer is 204.\n\nNow we need to output in a format: \"Solution: ...\" then final answer.\n\nWe need to include step by step.\n\nThus final output:\n\nSolution:\nLet s be speed in km/h, t minutes coffee break. Then 9/s + t/60 = 4, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract to get 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6 => 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 11.25 => s = 2.5 km/h. Then t = 24 min. For speed s+0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 h. Add coffee break 24 min => total = 3 h 24 min = 204 min. So answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nYes.\n\nWill output that.\n\nMake sure to include the final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow, we need to ensure we follow the instruction: \"You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we must put the answer inside \\boxed{}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to output the solution steps and final answer.\n\nNow, let's produce final answer.\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n",
