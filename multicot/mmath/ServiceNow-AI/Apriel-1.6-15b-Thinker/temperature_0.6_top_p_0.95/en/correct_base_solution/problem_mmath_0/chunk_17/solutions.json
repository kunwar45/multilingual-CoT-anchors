So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. So we have:\n\n9 / s + t/60 = 4. (Equation 1)\n9 / (s+2) + t/60 = 2.4.

Total time = 3 + 24/60 = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m.

Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes.

Total time = 9/3 + t/60 = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3h24m = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe need to ensure we include the final answer in \\boxed{}.\n\nThus final output: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow we need to output the solution in a nice format.\n\nWe'll produce a solution with steps.\n\nNow, we need to consider if any rounding needed?

So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. So we have:\n\n9 / s + t/60 = 4. (Equation 1)\n\n9 / (s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. (Equation 2)\n\nWe need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h: total time = 9 / (s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes.\n\nWe have two equations with unknowns s and t. Solve.\n\nEquation 1: 9/s + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 4 - 9/s => t = 60*(4 - 9/s) = 240 - 540/s.\n\nEquation 2: 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4 => t/60 = 2.4 - 9/(s+2) => t = 60*(2.4 - 9/(s+2)) = 144 - 540/(s+2).\n\nSet t equal: 240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2). Solve:\n\n240 - 540/s = 144 - 540/(s+2)\n\nBring terms: 240 - 144 = 540/s - 540/(s+2)\n\n=> 96 = 540*(1/s - 1/(s+2))\n\n=> 96 = 540 * ((s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))) = 540 * (2 / (s(s+2))) = 1080 / (s(s+2))\n\nThus: 96 = 1080 / (s(s+2)) => s(s+2) = 1080 / 96 = 11.25? Let's compute: 1080/96 = (1080/12)/8 = 90/8 = 11.25. Yes.\n\nSo s(s+2) = 11.25.\n\nSolve quadratic: s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0.\n\nCompute discriminant: D = 4 + 45 = 49. Because 4*11.25 = 45. So D = 4 + 45 = 49. sqrt(D) = 7.\n\nThus s = [-2 ± 7] / 2 = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5, or (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 (reject negative speed). So s = 2.5 km/h.\n\nNow find t: t = 240 - 540/s = 240 - 540/2.5 = 240 - 216 = 24 minutes. Check with other equation: t = 144 - 540/(s+2) = 144 - 540/4.5 = 144 - 120 = 24. Yes.\n\nThus t = 24 minutes.\n\nNow compute total time at speed s+0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h.\n\nWalking time = distance / speed = 9 / 3 = 3 hours.\n\nTotal time = walking time + t minutes = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3 hours + 0.4 hours = 3.4 hours = 3 hours 24 minutes.\n\nConvert to minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes.\n\nThus answer: 204 minutes.\n\nBut we need to output as \\boxed{204}. Let's double-check everything.\n\nCheck original times: At speed 2.5 km/h, walking time = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3h 36m. Add t = 24 min => total = 4h? 3h 36m + 24m = 4h 0m. Yes matches.\n\nAt speed 4.5 km/h (s+2), walking time = 9/4.5 = 2 hours. Add 24 min = 2h 24m. Yes matches.\n\nThus answer is correct.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nBut we need to ensure the answer is in minutes. Yes.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow we need to output as per instructions: \"You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we will output \\boxed{204}.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWe should also show step-by-step solution? The problem says \"Solution:\" but we need to output final answer. The prompt says \"Solve this math problem step by step. You MUST put your final answer in \\boxed{}.\" So we need to provide solution steps and then final answer. The solution we derived is step by step. Let's produce a clear solution.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Let }s\\text{ be the speed in km/h and }t\\text{ the coffee‑shop time in minutes.}\\\\\n&\\text{Total time (hours)}= \\frac{9}{s}+\\frac{t}{60}=4 \\quad\\Rightarrow\\quad \\frac{t}{60}=4-\\frac{9}{s}.\\\\\n&\\text{When speed is }s+2:\\ \\frac{9}{s+2}+\\frac{t}{60}=2\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=2.4.\\\\\n&\\Rightarrow\\ \\frac{t}{60}=2.4-\\frac{9}{s+2}.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Equate the two expressions for }t/60:\\\\\n&4-\\frac{9}{s}=2.4-\\frac{9}{s+2}\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow 1.6=\\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}\n   =9\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\Bigr)\n   =9\\Bigl(\\frac{2}{s(s+2)}\\Bigr)\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow \\frac{2}{s(s+2)}=\\frac{1.6}{9}=\\frac{16}{90}=\\frac{8}{45}\\\\\n&\\Longrightarrow s(s+2)=\\frac{2\\cdot45}{8}= \\frac{90}{8}=11.25.\\\\\n&\\text{Solve }s^2+2s-11.25=0:\\\\\n&\\Delta=4+45=49,\\;\\sqrt\\Delta=7\\\\\n&s=\\frac{-2+7}{2}=2.5\\ \\text{km/h}\\ (\\text{positive speed}).\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Find }t:\\;t=60\\Bigl(4-\\frac{9}{2.5}\\Bigr)=60(4-3.6)=24\\text{ minutes}.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\text{Now at speed }s+\\tfrac12=3\\text{ km/h:}\\\\\n&\\text{walking time}= \\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h}=180\\text{ min}.\\\\\n&\\text{total time}=180\\text{ min}+24\\text{ min}=204\\text{ min}.\\\\[4pt]\n&\\boxed{204}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\]\n\\]\n\\boxed{204}\n",
