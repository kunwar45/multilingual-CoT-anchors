Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km.

Problem: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then total = 2.0 + 24/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 = 2h24m matches. Good.\n\nNow we need total time when speed = s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = 9 / 3.0 = 3.0 hours. Add coffee shop time t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total = 3.0 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h24m. So answer: 3 hours 24 minutes = 204 minutes? Wait 3h = 180 min, +24 = 204 minutes. So answer: 204 minutes.\n\nBut the problem asks: \"Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the t minutes spent in the coffee shop.\" So answer is 204 minutes. So final answer: \\boxed{204}. Let's double-check everything.\n\nGiven s = 2.5 km/h, walking time at s = 9/2.5 = 3.6 h = 3h24m. Adding t = 24 min yields total 4h = 240 min. Good. At s+2 = 4.5 km/h, walking time = 9/4.5 = 2h = 120 min. Adding 24 min yields total 2h24m = 144 min. Indeed 2h24m = 144 min. So everything consistent.\n\nNow at s+0.5 = 3.0 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3h = 180 min. Adding 24 min yields 204 min = 3h24m. So answer is 204.\n\nThus final answer: \\boxed{204}.

Problem: Every morning Aya goes for a $9$-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards. When she walks at a constant speed of $s$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 4 hours, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. When she walks $s+2$ kilometers per hour, the walk takes her 2 hours and 24 minutes, including $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Suppose Aya walks at $s+\\frac{1}{2}$ kilometers per hour. Find the number of minutes the walk takes her, including the $t$ minutes spent in the coffee shop. Solution: \n<think>\nWe need to parse the problem: Aya walks a 9 km walk (presumably the distance from start to coffee shop and back? Actually it's a 9 km walk that ends at coffee shop? Let's read: \"Every morning Aya goes for a 9-kilometer-long walk and stops at a coffee shop afterwards.\" So she walks 9 km, then stops at coffee shop for t minutes. So total time includes walking time plus t minutes. When she walks at speed s km/h, total time = 4 hours (including coffee shop). So walking time = 4h - t (converted to hours). Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h. So total time = 9/(s+0.5) + t/60. Then convert to minutes. We need to solve for s and t. Subtract Eq2 from Eq1: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 4 - 2.4 = 1.6 Compute left side: 9 * [1/s - 1/(s+2)] = 9 * [(s+2 - s) / (s(s+2))] = 9 * [2 / (s(s+2))] = 18 / (s(s+2)) Thus: 18 / (s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 18 / 1.6 = 11.25 Compute: 18 / 1.6 = (180/16) = 11.25 indeed. Thus s^2 + 2s - 11.25 = 0 Solve: s = [-2 ± sqrt(4 + 45)] / 2 = [-2 ± sqrt(49)] / 2 = [-2 ± 7] / 2 Thus s = (-2 + 7)/2 = 5/2 = 2.5 km/h, or s = (-2 - 7)/2 = -9/2 = -4.5 km/h (reject negative). So s = 2.5 km/h. Now find t. Use Eq1: 9 / s + t/60 = 4 => 9 / 2.5 = 3.6. So 3.6 + t/60 = 4 => t/60 = 0.4 => t = 24 minutes. Check Eq2: 9/(s+2) = 9/(4.5) = 2.0. Then 2.0 + t/60 = 2.0 + 0.4 = 2.4 => matches. Good.\n\nNow we need total time for speed s + 0.5 = 2.5 + 0.5 = 3.0 km/h. So walking time = 9 / 3 = 3 hours. Add coffee shop time t = 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total = 3.4 hours = 3 hours + 0.4*60 = 3 hours + 24 minutes = 3h 24m. Convert to minutes: 3*60 + 24 = 180 + 24 = 204 minutes. So answer: 204 minutes. But the problem likely expects answer in minutes. So answer: \\boxed{204}. Let's double-check.\n\nCheck: At s = 2.5 km/h, walking time = 9/2.5 = 3.6 hours = 3h 36m. Adding 24 min => total 4h. Good. At s+2 = 4.5 km/h, walking time = 9/4.5 = 2h. Adding 24 min => 2h 24m. Good. At s+0.5 = 3 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3h. Adding 24 min => 3h 24m = 204 minutes.

Similarly, at speed s+2 km/h, total time = 2 hours 24 minutes = 2 + 24/60 = 2.4 hours? Wait 24 minutes = 0.4 hours. So total time = 2.4 hours. So walking time = 2.4h - t. We have distance = 9 km. So walking time = distance / speed. Thus: 9 / s + t (in hours) = 4? Actually total time = walking time + t minutes. But t is in minutes, need to convert to hours. Let's denote t minutes = t/60 hours. So total time in hours = walking time + t/60. Thus: 9/s + t/60 = 4   (Equation 1)\n9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4   (Equation 2) We need to find total time when speed = s + 0.5 km/h.

Compute total time at s+0.5: 9/(3) + 24/60 = 3 + 0.4 = 3.4 hours = 204 minutes.\n6. Answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nWill do.\n\nNow produce final answer.\n\\boxed{204}\n\n**Solution**\n\nLet \\(t\\) be the number of minutes Aya spends at the coffee shop (so \\(t/60\\) hours).  \nThe walking distance is \\(9\\) km.\n\n1. **Write the total‑time equations.**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s}+\\frac{t}{60}=4 \\qquad\\text{(speed }s\\text{, total time }4\\text{ h)} \\tag{1}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s+2}+\\frac{t}{60}=2\\text{ h }24\\text{ min}=2.4 \\qquad\\text{(speed }s+2\\text{, total time }2.4\\text{ h)} \\tag{2}\n   \\]\n\n2. **Eliminate \\(t\\) by subtracting (2) from (1).**  \n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{s}-\\frac{9}{s+2}=4-2.4=1.6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9\\Bigl(\\frac{1}{s}-\\frac{1}{s+2}\\Bigr)=1.6\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   9\\Bigl(\\frac{(s+2)-s}{s(s+2)}\\Bigr)=\\frac{18}{s(s+2)}=1.6\n   \\]\n   Hence\n   \\[\n   s(s+2)=\\frac{18}{1.6}=11.25.\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\(s\\).**  \n   \\[\n   s^{2}+2s-11.25=0\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   s=\\frac{-2\\pm\\sqrt{4+45}}{2}=\\frac{-2\\pm7}{2}.\n   \\]\n   The positive root gives \\(s= \\frac{5}{2}=2.5\\) km/h (the negative root is extraneous).\n\n4. **Find \\(t\\).** Using (1):\n   \\[\n   \\frac{9}{2.5}+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;3.6+\\frac{t}{60}=4\\;\\Longrightarrow\\;\\frac{t}{60}=0.4.\n   \\]\n   Thus \\(t=0.4\\times60=24\\) minutes.\n\n5. **Compute the total time when the speed is \\(s+\\tfrac12 = 3\\) km/h.**  \n   \\[\n   \\text{Walking time}= \\frac{9}{3}=3\\text{ h},\\qquad\n   \\text{Coffee‑shop time}= \\frac{24}{60}=0.4\\text{ h}.\n   \\]\n   Total time \\(=3+0.4=3.4\\) h \\(=3.4\\times60=204\\) minutes.\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{204}\n\\]\n\n",
