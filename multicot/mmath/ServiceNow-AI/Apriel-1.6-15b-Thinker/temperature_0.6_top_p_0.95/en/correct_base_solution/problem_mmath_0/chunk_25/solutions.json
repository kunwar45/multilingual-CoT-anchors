Let's produce a clear solution.\n\nWill produce a solution:\n\nLet t minutes = t/60 hours. Write equations: 9/s + t/60 = 4, 9/(s+2) + t/60 = 2.4. Subtract to find s: 9/s - 9/(s+2) = 1.6 => 18/(s(s+2)) = 1.6 => s(s+2) = 11.25 => s = 2.5. Then t = 24 minutes. Then speed s+0.5 = 3.0 km/h, walking time = 9/3 = 3 h, total time = 3 h + 24 min = 3h24m = 204 min. So answer: \\boxed{204}.\n\nThus final answer.\n\nWill output that.\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n&\\text{Let }t\\text{ be the coffee‑shop time in minutes.
