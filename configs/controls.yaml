controls:
  sentence_boundaries:
    enabled: true
    description: >
      All pivot scoring operates on sentence spans (not raw token positions),
      using character-level sentence boundaries from pysbd. This reduces
      tokenizer/script artifacts.

  paraphrase_within_language:
    enabled: true
    description: >
      Within a language, generate paraphrased versions of reasoning traces
      (different phrasing, same logical steps) and compare pivot locations
      and scores to the originals.
    sample_size: 20

  backtranslation_optional:
    enabled: false
    description: >
      Optional control: translate Target-CoT traces to English and back to the
      target language (back-translation), then compare pivot scores and
      accuracy. Enable only if you have capacity for extra model calls.
